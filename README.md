## About the project

This projects aims to achieve the following goals: 
1. Integration of Greek language to spaCy.io platform
2. Natural Language Processing of Greek documents in order to extract valuable information such as named entities, sentiment analysis, tags, etc.

The project got selected for Google Summer of Code 2018 under the auspices of GFOSS organization.

## Problem Statement

We live in the era of data. **Every minute**, 3.8 billion internet users, produce content; more than 120 million emails , 500.000 Facebook comments, 3 million Google searches. If we want to process that amount of data efficiently, we need to process natural language. Open source projects such as spaCy, textblob, or NLTK contribute signifficantly to that direction and thus they need to be reinforced.

This project is about improving the quality of Natural Language Processing of Greek Language. The first step is to integrate Greek Language to spaCy. During that process, innovative approaches will be used. It is of vital importance for the writer and for the mentors of the program to identify which of them are of practical use for spaCy and to share the results in order to support any other open source enthusiast who is interested. In the fortunate scenario of successful integration of Greek Language to spaCy, the greek model will be trained and used for extraction of valuable information such as emotions detection in Greek texts, entity extraction, etc.
